Configuration flags
===================

This section describes the non-standard flags added to the 'configure'
script.

* Variable: ATF_WORKDIR
  Possible values: empty, an absolute path.
  Default: /tmp or /var/tmp, depending on availability.

  Specifies the directory that ATF will use to place its temporary files
  and work directories for test cases.  This is just a default and can
  be overriden at run time.

* Flag: --enable-developer
  Possible values: yes, no
  Default: Depends on the version number.  Stable versions define this
           to 'no' while all others have it set to 'yes'.

  Enables several features useful for development, such as the inclusion
  of debugging symbols in all objects or the enabling of warnings during
  compilation.
