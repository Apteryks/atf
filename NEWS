Version 0.3
===========

Release date: UNDER DEVELOPMENT; NOT RELEASED YET!
Status:       Experimental

Changes:

* Added XML output support to atf-report.  This is accompanied by a DTD for
  the format's structure and sample XSLT/CSS files to post-process this
  output and convert it to a plain HTML report.

* Changed atf-run to add system information to the report it generates.
  This is currently only used by atf-report's XML output, and later printed
  in the HTML reports in a nice and useful summary table.  The user and
  system administrator are allowed to tune this feature by means of hooks.

* Removed the test cases' 'isolated' property.  This was intended to avoid
  touching the file system at all when running the related test case, but
  this has not been true for a long while given that some control files are
  unconditionally required for several purposes.  This way we get rid of
  several critical and delicate code.

* Improved atf-report's csv output format to include information about
  test programs too.


Version 0.2
===========

Release date: September 20th, 2007
Status:       Experimental

Changes:

* Test cases now get a known umask on entry.

* atf-run now detects many unexpected failures caused by test programs
  and reports them as bogus tests.  atf-report is able to handle these
  new errors and nicely reports them to the user.

* All the data formats read and written by the tools have been documented
  and cleaned up.  These include those grammars that define how the
  different components communicate with each other as well as the format
  of files written by the developers and users: the Atffiles and the
  configuration files.

* Added the atf-version tool, a utility that displays information about the
  currently installed version of ATF.

* Test cases can now define an optional cleanup routine to undo their
  actions regardless of their exit status.

* atf-report now summarizes the list of failed (bogus) test programs when
  using the ticker output format.

* Test programs now capture some termination signals and clean up any
  temporary files before exiting the program.

* Multiple bug fixes and improvements all around.


Version 0.1
===========

Release date: August 20th, 2007
Status:       Experimental

Changes:

* First public version.  This was released coinciding with the end of the
  Google Summer of Code 2007 program.
