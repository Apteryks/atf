Version 0.2
===========

Release date: STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT; NOT RELEASED
Status:       Experimental

Changes:

* Test cases now get a known umask on entry.

* atf-run now detects many unexpected failures caused by test programs
  and reports them as bogus tests.  atf-report is able to handle these
  new errors and nicely reports them to the user.

* All the data formats read and written by the tools have been documented
  and cleaned up.  These include those grammars that define how the
  different components communicate with each other as well as the format
  of files written by the developers and users: the Atffiles and the
  configuration files.

* Added the atf-version tool, a utility that displays information about the
  currently installed version of ATF.

* Test cases can now define an optional cleanup routine to undo their
  actions regardless of their exit status.


Version 0.1
===========

Release date: August 20th, 2007
Status:       Experimental

Changes:

* First public version.  This was released coinciding with the end of the
  Google Summer of Code 2007 program.
