Things to do
============

This project is still in very early stages of development.  The list
below is very incomplete, but it details some items that have to be
addressed.  Basically they are here so that they are not omitted.

* Implement wildcard filtering for test names in test programs.

* Make the report class purely abstract and implement different report
  outputs.  The current one is fine to be parsed by other programs, but
  is not specially readable by humans.

* Replace #ifndef by #if !defined.

* Test cases should be isolated to run in an independent directory.

* Test cases should be safe to closing stdin, stdout and stderr, to
  some extent.  Once implemented, make t_file_handle.cpp and t_pipe.cpp
  use stdout again, instead of stderr.
