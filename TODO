Things to do
============

This project is still in very early stages of development.  The list
below is very incomplete, but it details some items that have to be
addressed.  Basically they are here so that they are not omitted.

* Implement wildcard filtering for test names in test programs.

* Make the report class purely abstract and implement different report
  outputs.  The current one is fine to be parsed by other programs, but
  is not specially readable by humans.
