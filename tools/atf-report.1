.Sh NAME
.Nm atf-report
.Nd transforms the output of atf-run to different formats
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl o Ar fmt1:path1 Op .. Fl o Ar fmtN:pathN
.Nm
.Fl h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
reads the output of
.Nm atf-run
and transforms it to different formats.
Some of these are user-friendly and others are machine-parseable, which
opens a wide range of possibilities to analyze the results of a test
suite's execution.
See
.Sx Output formats
below for more details on which these formats are.
.Pp
In the first synopsis form,
.Nm
reads the output of
.Nm atf-run
through its standard input and, if no
.Fl o
options are given, prints a user-friendly report on its standard
output using the
.Sq ticker
format.
If
.Fl o
options are provided (more than one are allowed), they specify the complete
list of reports to generate.
They are all generated simulatneously, and for obvious reasons, two reports
cannot be written to the same file.
Note that the default output is suppressed when
.Fl o
is provided.
.Pp
In the second synopsis form,
.Nm
will print information about all supported options and their purpose.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width XoXfmtXpathXX
.It Fl h
Shows a short summary of all available options and their purpose.
.It Fl o Ar fmt:path
Adds a new output format.
.Ar fmt
is one of the formats described later on in
.Sx Output formats .
.Ar path
specifies where the report will be written to.
Depending on the chosen format, this may refer to a single file or to
a directory.
For those formats that write to a single file, specifying a
.Sq -
as the path will redirect the report to the standard output.
.El
.Ss Output formats
The following output formats are allowed:
.Bl -tag -width tickerXX
.It csv
A machine-parseable Comma-Separated Values (CSV) file.
Each line of the result is of the form:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
test-program,test-case,result[,reason]
.Ed
.It ticker
A user-friendly report that shows the progress of the test suite's
execution as it operates.
This type of report should always be redirected to a virtual terminal,
not a file, as it may use control sequences that will make the output
unreadable in regular files.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The most simple way of running a test suite is to pipe the output of
.Nm atf-run
through
.Nm
without any additional flags.
This will use the default output format, which is suitable to most users:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
atf-run | atf-report
.Ed
.Pp
In some situations, it may be interesting to get a machine-parseable file
aside from the standard report.
This can be done as follows:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
atf-run | atf-report -o csv:testsuite.csv -o ticker:-
.Ed
.Pp
Or if the standard report is not desired, thus achieving completely silent
operation:
atf-run | atf-report -o csv:testsuite.csv
