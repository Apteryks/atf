.Nd kills a process tree
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm

.Nm
.Fl h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a utility that recursively kills all children of a given process;
in other words, it kills a process tree.
The algorithm used iterates over the tree from top to bottom.
For each process, it sends a
.Sq SIGSTOP
to it to freeze its execution, then looks for all of its live children,
stores this list and at last sends the requested signal to the process
followed by a
.Sq SIGCONT
to resume its execution.
(In some platforms this last step is done the other way around, though.)
This process is later restarted on each of the children processes.
.Pp
In the first synopsis form,
.Nm
proceeds to kill the given process and all of its children.
.Pp
In the second synopsis form,
.Nm
will print information about all supported options and their purpose.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Fl h
Shows a short summary of all available options and their purpose.
.It Fl s Ar signal
Specifies the (numerical) signal to be sent.
Defaults to
.Sq SIGTERM .
