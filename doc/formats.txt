Data formats
============

This file describes the multiple data formats used in ATF.  These formats
affect configuration files, control files and any data that is externalized
or internalized by the tools.

Data files are always organized as follows:

    Header1: Value1            \
    ...                        | head
    HeaderN: ValueN            /
                               mandatory blank line
    Free-form text contents    \
    ...                        | body
    ...                        /

A file must always contain a "Content-Type" header and must always separate
that header from the body with a blank line, even if the body is empty.

The "Content-Type" is of the form:

    Content-Type: application/X-atf-<subtype>; version="<version>"

Where "subtype" indicates the specific file format and "version" its format
version.  This header must be the first one of the file.

The main purpose of the "Content-Type" header, aside from determining the
format used in the file, is to allow future changes to a given format.
Whenever an incompatible change is made, the version is bumped by one.  By
keeping the header in the first line, future versions may even remove the
need for such a header -- e.g. if some format was replaced by XML files,
which have they own mandatory header.

The rest of this file details the different format types.
