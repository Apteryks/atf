Introduction
============

This document describes the procedure to create and publish a new ATF
release.  It is provided as a check-list, which must be followed in the
order provided.  If there is any problem in any step, it must be fixed
and the whole process must be restarted from scratch.


Requirements
============

* NetBSD-current.  (The release scripts assume that some utilities have
  specifc names, and those names change in, e.g. Linux.)
* pkgsrc/devel/autoconf.
* pkgsrc/devel/automake.
* pkgsrc/devel/gmake.
* pkgsrc/devel/libtool-base.
* pkgsrc/devel/pkg-config.
* pkgsrc/security/gnupg.
* pkgsrc/security/sudo.
* pkgsrc/textproc/docbook-simple.
* pkgsrc/textproc/libxml2.
* pkgsrc/textproc/libxslt.
* pkgsrc/www/links.
* pkgsrc/www/tidy.


Release procedure
=================

If any step fails, it must be fixed and the whole process must restart from
the beginning.

* Run 'make distcheck'.

* Run 'make release-test'.

* Integrate the new release into NetBSD.  See "Integrate into NetBSD" below.

* Integrate the new release into pkgsrc.  See "Integrate into pkgsrc" below.

* Run 'make release'.  Store the resulting directory in a safe place.

At this point, the release files are final.  So:

* Tag the release in the repository using a tag name that matches the
  distfile's base name.  Typically: atf-<major>.<minor>[.<micro>]

* Publish the release as described in "Publish the release".


Integrate into NetBSD
=====================

* Build a complete release of NetBSD/amd64 current, install it and run all
  the tests in it.  Store the output of this run.

* Import the new release into the NetBSD source tree.

* Rebuild and install the same NetBSD release, *without* updating the
  source tree.  Rerun all the tests in it.  Compare the output with the
  previous run and ensure there are no regressions caused by ATF itself.


Integrate into pkgsrc
=====================

* Update the ATF package in pkgsrc to the new release and ensure it builds
  and installs without any patches.  Run all the tests in prefix/tests to
  make sure they work.


Publish a release
=================

* Upload the release directory created by 'make release' to the FTP server.
  The current root for releases is:

      ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/misc/jmmv/atf/

  So, after the update, the following files must exist in this root:

      .../<major>.<minor>[.<micro>]/atf-<major>.<minor>[.<micro>].asc
      .../<major>.<minor>[.<micro>]/atf-<major>.<minor>[.<micro>].cksums
      .../<major>.<minor>[.<micro>]/atf-<major>.<minor>[.<micro>].tar.gz

* Announce the new version in the ATF's web page.

* Announce the new version in the ATF's project page at Freshmeat.net.
