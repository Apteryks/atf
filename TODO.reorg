Changes to be done to the reorg branch
--------------------------------------

* Remove d_ and h_ prefixes from files moved into the top-level directories.

* Possibly rename the top-level test-programs directory; it's misleading.

* Split Makefile.am.m4 into one file per directory.  Evaluate if we want to
  perform inclusions or recursions.  Probably drop M4 altogether; it's sick.
